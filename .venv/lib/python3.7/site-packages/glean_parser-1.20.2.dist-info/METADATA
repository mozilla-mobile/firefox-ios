============
Glean Parser
============

Parser tools for Mozilla's Glean telemetry.

Features
--------

Parses the ``metrics.yaml`` files for the Glean telemetry SDK and produces
output for various integrations.

Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is available `here <https://mozilla.github.io/glean_parser/>`__.

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.5 (or later)

The following library requirements are installed automatically when glean_parser
is installed by `pip`.

- appdirs
- Click
- diskcache
- Jinja2
- jsonschema
- PyYAML

Additionally on Python 3.6 and 3.5:

- iso8601

And on Python 3.5:

- pep487

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: console

  $ glean_parser --help

Read in `metrics.yaml`, translate to kotlin format, and output to `output_dir`:

.. code-block:: console

  $ glean_parser translate -o output_dir -f kotlin metrics.yaml

Check a Glean ping against the ping schema:

.. code-block:: console

  $ glean_parser check < ping.json

Unreleased
----------

1.12.2 (2020-04-24)
-------------------

* Dependencies that depend on the version of Python being used are now specified using the `Declaring platform specific dependencies syntax in setuptools <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-platform-specific-dependencies>`__. This means that more recent versions of dependencies are likely to be installed on Python 3.6 and later, and unnecessary backport libraries won't be installed on more recent Python versions.

1.12.1 (2020-04-21)
-------------------

* The minimum version of the runtime dependencies has been lowered to increase compatibility with other tools.  These minimum versions are now tested in CI, in addition to testing the latest versions of the dependencies that was already happening in CI.

1.20.0 (2020-04-15)
-------------------

* **Breaking change:** glinter errors found during the `translate` command will now return an error code. glinter warnings will be displayed, but not return an error code.
* `glean_parser` now produces a linter warning when `user` lifetime metrics are
  set to expire. See [bug 1604854](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1604854)
  for additional context.

1.19.0 (2020-03-18)
-------------------

* **Breaking change:** The regular expression used to validate labels is
  stricter and more correct.
* Add more information about pings to markdown documentation:
  * State whether the ping includes client id;
  * Add list of data review links;
  * Add list of related bugs links.
* `glean_parser` now makes it easier to write external translation functions for
  different language targets.
* BUGFIX: glean_parser now works on 32-bit Windows.

1.18.3 (2020-02-24)
-------------------

* Dropped the 'inflection' dependency.
* Constrained the 'zipp' and 'MarkupSafe' transitive dependencies to versions that
  support Python 3.5.

1.18.2 (2020-02-14)
-------------------

* BUGFIX: Fix rendering of first element of reason list.

1.18.1 (2020-02-14)
-------------------

* BUGFIX: Reason codes are displayed in markdown output for built-in pings as
  well.
* BUGFIX: Reason descriptions are indented correctly in markdown output.
* BUGFIX: To avoid a compiler error, the @JvmName annotation isn't added to
  private members.

1.18.0 (2020-02-13)
-------------------

* **Breaking Change (Java API)** Have the metrics names in Java match the names in Kotlin.
  See [Bug 1588060](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1588060).
* The reasons a ping are sent are now included in the generated markdown documentation.

1.17.3 (2020-02-05)
-------------------

* BUGFIX: The version of Jinja2 now specifies < 3.0, since that version no
  longer supports Python 3.5.

-------------------

* BUGFIX: Fixes an import error in generated Kotlin code.

1.17.1 (2020-02-05)

-------------------

* Support for `reason` codes on pings was added.

1.15.6 (2020-02-06)

-------------------

* BUGFIX: Also allow the legacy name `all_pings` for `send_in_pings` parameter on metrics

-------------------

* The Kotlin linter `detekt` is now run during CI, and for local
  testing if installed.

* Python 3.8 is now tested in CI (in addition to Python 3.7).
  Using `tox` for this doesn't work in modern versions of CircleCI, so
  the `tox` configuration has been removed.

* `yamllint` has been added to test the YAML files on CI.

* ⚠ Metric types that don't yet have implementations in glean-core have been
  removed. This includes `enumeration`, `rate`, `usage`, and `use_counter`, as

1.8.0 (2019-09-26)
