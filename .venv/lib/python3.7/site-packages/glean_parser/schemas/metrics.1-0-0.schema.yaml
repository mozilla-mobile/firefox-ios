  Schema for the metrics.yaml files for Mozilla's Glean telemetry SDK.

  The top-level of the `metrics.yaml` file has a key defining each category of
  metrics. Categories must be snake_case, and they may also have dots `.` to
  define subcategories.

    type: object

    additionalProperties: false

    properties:
      type:
        title: Metric type
        description: |
          **Required.**

          Specifies the type of a metric, like "counter" or "event". This
          defines which operations are valid for the metric, how it is stored
          and how data analysis tooling displays it.

          The supported types are:
            - `event`: Record a specific event (with optional metadata).
              Additional properties: `extra_keys`.

            - `boolean`: A metric storing values of true or false.

            - `string`: A metric storing Unicode string values.

            - `string_list`: a list of Unicode strings.

            - `counter`: A numeric value that can only be incremented.

            - `quantity`: A numeric value that is set directly. Only allowed for
              metrics coming from GeckoView.

            - `timespan`: Represents a time interval. Additional properties:
              `time_unit`.

            - `timing_distribution`: Record the distribution of multiple
              timings. Additional properties: `time_unit`.

            - `datetime`: A date/time value. Represented as an ISO datetime in
              UTC. Additional properties: `time_unit`.

            - `uuid`: Record a UUID v4.

            - `memory_distribution`: A histogram for recording memory usage
              values. Additional properties: `memory_unit`.

            - `custom_distribution`: A histogram with a custom range and number
              of buckets. This metric type is for legacy support only and is
              only allowed for metrics coming from GeckoView. Additional
              properties: `range_min`, `range_max`, `bucket_count`,
              `histogram_type`.

            - Additionally, labeled versions of many metric types are supported.
              These support the `labels`_ parameter, allowing multiple instances
              of the metric to be stored at a given set of labels. The labeled
              metric types include:

                `labeled_boolean`, `labeled_string`, `labeled_counter`.

        type: string
        enum:
          - event
          - boolean
          - string
          - string_list
          - counter
          - quantity
          - timespan
          - timing_distribution
          - custom_distribution
          - memory_distribution
          - datetime
          - uuid
          - labeled_boolean
          - labeled_string
          - labeled_counter

      description:
        title: Description
        description: |
          **Required.**

          A textual description of what this metric does, what it means, and its
          edge cases or any other helpful information.

          Descriptions may contain [markdown
          syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
        type: string

      lifetime:
        title: Lifetime
        description: |
          Defines the lifetime of the metric. It must be one of the following
          values:

          - `ping` (default): The metric is reset each time it is sent in a
            ping.

          - `user`: The metric contains a property that is part of the user's
            profile and is never reset.

          - `application`: The metric contains a property that is related to the
            application, and is reset only at application restarts.
        enum:
          - ping
          - user
          - application
        default: ping

      send_in_pings:
        title: Send in pings
        description: |
          Which pings the metric should be sent on. If not specified, the metric
          is sent on the "default ping", which is the `events` ping for events,
          and the `metrics` ping for everything else. Most metrics don't need to
          specify this.

          (There is an additional special value of `all-pings` for internal
          Glean metrics only that is used to indicate that a metric may appear
          in any ping.)
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: "#/definitions/kebab_case"
        default:
          - default

      notification_emails:
        title: Notification emails
        description: |
          **Required.**

          A list of email addresses to notify for important events with the
          metric or when people with context or ownership for the metric need to
          be contacted.
        type: array
        minItems: 1
        items:
          type: string
          format: email

      bugs:
        title: Related bugs
        description: |
          **Required.**

          A list of bug URLs (e.g. Bugzilla and Github) that are relevant to
          this metric, e.g., tracking its original implementation or later
          changes to it.

          Using bug numbers alone is deprecated and will be an error in the
          future. Each entry should be a full URL to the bug in its tracker.
        type: array
        minItems: 1
        items:
          anyOf:
            - type: integer
            - type: string
              format: uri

      data_reviews:
        title: Review references
        description: |
          **Required.**

          A list of URIs to any data collection reviews relevant to the metric.
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
          format: uri

      disabled:
        title: Disabled
        description: |
          If `true`, the metric is disabled, and any metric collection on it
          will be silently ignored at runtime.
        type: boolean
        default: false

      expires:
        title: Expires
        description: |
          **Required.**

          May be one of the following values:
            - `<build date>`: An ISO date `yyyy-mm-dd` in UTC on which the
              metric expires. For example, `2019-03-13`. This date is checked at
              build time. Except in special cases, this form should be used so
              that the metric automatically "sunsets" after a period of time.
            - `never`: This metric never expires.
            - `expired`: This metric is manually expired.
        type: string
        pattern: "(never)|(expired)|([0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2})"

      version:
        title: Metric version
        description: |
          The version of the metric. A monotonically increasing value. If not
          provided, defaults to 0.

      time_unit:
        title: Time unit
        description: |
          Specifies the unit that the metric will be stored and displayed in. If
          not provided, it defaults to milliseconds. Time values are sent to the
          backend as integers, so `time_unit`_ determines the maximum resolution
          at which timespans are recorded. Times are always truncated, not
          rounded, to the nearest time unit. For example, a measurement of 25 ns
          will be returned as 0 ms if `time_unit` is `"millisecond"`.

          Valid when `type`_ is `timespan`, `timing_distribution` or `datetime`.
        enum:
          - nanosecond
          - microsecond
          - millisecond
          - second
          - minute
          - hour
          - day

      memory_unit:
        title: Memory unit
        description: |
          The unit that the incoming memory size values are recorded in.

          The units are the power-of-2 units, so "kilobyte" is correctly a
          "kibibyte".

          - kilobyte == 2^10 ==         1,024 bytes
          - megabyte == 2^20 ==     1,048,576 bytes
          - gigabyte == 2^30 == 1,073,741,824 bytes

          Values are automatically converted to and transmitted as bytes.

          Valid when `type`_ is `memory_distribution`.
        enum:
          - byte
          - kilobyte
          - megabyte
          - gigabyte

      labels:
        title: Labels
        description: |
          A list of labels for a labeled metric.  If provided, the labels are
          enforced at run time, and recording to an unknown label is recorded
          to the special label `__other__`.  If not provided, the labels
          may be anything, but using too many unique labels will put some
          labels in the special label `__other__`.

          Valid with any of the labeled metric types.
        anyOf:
          - type: array
            uniqueItems: true
            items:
              $ref: "#/definitions/labeled_metric_id"
            maxItems: 16
          - type: "null"

      extra_keys:
        title: Extra keys
        description: |
          The acceptable keys on the "extra" object sent with events. This is an
          object mapping the key to an object containing metadata about the key.
          This metadata object has the following keys:

            - `description`: **Required.** A description of the key.

          Valid when `type`_ is `event`.

      gecko_datapoint:
        title: Gecko Datapoint
        description: |
          This is a Gecko-specific property. It is the name of the Gecko metric
          to accumulate the data from, when using the Glean SDK in a product
          using GeckoView. See bug 1566356 for more context.

        type: string

      range_min:
        title: Range minimum
        description: |
          The minimum value of a custom distribution.

        type: number
        default: 1

      range_max:
        title: Range maximum
        description: |

        type: number
        minimum: 1
        maximum: 100

      histogram_type:
        title: Histogram type
        description: |
          The type of histogram bucketing to use:
            - `linear`: The buckets are linearly spaced within the range.
            - `exponential`: The buckets use the natural logarithmic so the
              smaller-valued buckets are smaller in size than the higher-valued
              buckets.

          Required when `type`_ is `custom_distribution`.
        enum:
          - linear
          - exponential

      unit:
        title: Unit
        description: |
          The unit of the metric, for metrics that don't already require a
          meaningful unit, such as `time_unit`.
          This is provided for informational purposes only and doesn't have any
