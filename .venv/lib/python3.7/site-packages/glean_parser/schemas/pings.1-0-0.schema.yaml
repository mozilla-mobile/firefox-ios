title: Pings
description: |
  Schema for the pings.yaml files for Mozilla's Glean telemetry SDK.

  The top-level of the `pings.yaml` file has a key defining the name of each
  ping. The values contain metadata about that ping. Ping names must be
  kebab-case per https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/cookbooks/new_ping.html

$id: moz://mozilla.org/schemas/glean/pings/1-0-0

definitions:
  dotted_snake_case:
    type: string
    pattern: "^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,29}(\\.[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{0,29})*$"
    maxLength: 40
  kebab_case:
    type: string
    # Bug 1601270; we allow 3 specific existing snake_cased ping names for now,
    # but these special cases can be removed once the number of legacy clients
    # sufficiently dwindles, likely in 2020H2.
    pattern: "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,29}$\
