# At one point SQLite was removing the DISTINCT keyword from expressions
# similar to:
#
#   <expr1> IN (SELECT DISTINCT <expr2> FROM...)
#
# However, there are a few obscure cases where this is incorrect. For
# example, if the SELECT features a LIMIT clause, or if the collation
# sequence or affinity used by the DISTINCT does not match the one used
# by the IN(...) expression.
