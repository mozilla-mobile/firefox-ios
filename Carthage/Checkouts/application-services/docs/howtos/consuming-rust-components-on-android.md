## Guide to Consuming Rust Components on Android

Welcome!

It's great that you want to include our Rust Components into your Android  app,
but we haven't written this guide yet.

In fact we're still deciding whether this guide is even necessary. For now you
probably want to find the corresponding component over in
[android-components](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/android-components/) and
consume it from there.

You might also want to read up on [consuming megazord
libraries](https://mozilla.github.io/application-services/docs/applications/consuming-megazord-libraries.html).
