## metrics
This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.
See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`metrics` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/metrics.html).
The following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| places_manager.read_query_count |[counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/counter.html) |The total number of read operations performed on the places store. The count only includes operations triggered by the application, not e.g. incidental reads performed as part of a sync. It is intended to be used together with `read_query_error_count` to measure the overall error rate of read operations on the places store.  |[1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607621)||2020-07-01 |
| places_manager.read_query_error_count |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |The total number of errors encountered during read operations on the places store, labeled by type. It is intended to be used together with `read_query_count` to measure the overall error rate of read operations on the places store.  |[1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607621)|<ul><li>url_parse_failed</li><li>operation_interrupted</li></ul>|2020-07-01 |
| places_manager.read_query_time |[timing_distribution](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/timing_distribution.html) |The time taken to execute a read query on the places store.  |[1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607621)||2020-07-01 |
| places_manager.scan_query_time |[timing_distribution](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/timing_distribution.html) |The time taken to execute a scan query on the places store. This metric is for queries that we expect to be costly e.g. getBookmarksTree(guid, recursive=True).  |[1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607621)||2020-07-01 |
| places_manager.write_query_count |[counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/counter.html) |The total number of write operations performed on the places store. The count only includes operations triggered by the application, not e.g. incidental writes performed as part of a sync. It is intended to be used together with `write_query_error_count` to measure the overall error rate of write operations on the places store.  |[1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607621)||2020-07-01 |
| places_manager.write_query_error_count |[labeled_counter](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/labeled_counters.html) |The total number of errors encountered during write operations on the places store, labeled by type.
