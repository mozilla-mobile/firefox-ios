# This file defines the metrics that will be gathered for the "places" storage component.
# These are emitted for all users of the component.  Additional metrics specific to the
# *syncing* of places are defined in a separate "sync_ping" package.
#
# Changes to these metrics require data review, which should take into consideration
# the following known consumers of the places component Android bindings:
#
#  * Fenix for Andriod

  read_query_count:
    type: counter
    description: >
      The total number of read operations performed on the places store.
      The count only includes operations triggered by the application, not e.g. incidental reads performed
      as part of a sync. It is intended to be used together with `read_query_error_count` to measure the
      overall error rate of read operations on the places store.

  read_query_error_count:
    type: labeled_counter
    description: >
      The total number of errors encountered during read operations on the places store, labeled by type.
      It is intended to be used together with `read_query_count` to measure the overall error rate
      of read operations on the places store.

      The total number of write operations performed on the places store.
      The count only includes operations triggered by the application, not e.g. incidental writes performed
      as part of a sync. It is intended to be used together with `write_query_error_count` to measure the
      overall error rate of write operations on the places store.
