# This file defines the metrics that will be gathered for the "logins" storage component.
# These are emitted for all users of the component.  Additional metrics specific to the
# *syncing* of logins are defined in a separate "sync_ping" package.
#
# Changes to these metrics require data review, which should take into consideration
# the following known consumers of the logins component Android bindings:
#
#  * Firefox Preview
#  * Firefox Lockwise for Android

logins_store:

  # These help us understand how much the logins store is being used, and whether it's succeeding
  # in the duties asked of it.  We'll use them to graph e.g. the error rate of applications trying
  # to use the logins store, and identify application or platform features that lead to unusually
  # high error rates.

    description: >
      The number of times the login store was unlocked.
      It is intended to be used together with `unlock_error_count` to measure the overall 
      error rate of unlocking the logins store.

  read_query_count:
    type: counter
    description: >
      The total number of read operations performed on the logins store.
      The count only includes operations triggered by the application, not e.g. incidental reads performed
      as part of a sync. It is intended to be used together with `read_query_error_count` to measure the 
      overall error rate of read operations on the logins store.

  # These help us understand the performance of the logins store in the wild.
