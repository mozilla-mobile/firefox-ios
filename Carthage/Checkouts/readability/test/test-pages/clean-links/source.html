            in comparing some brief document myself, calling Turkey or Nippers for
            this purpose. One object I had in placing Bartleby so handy to me behind
            the screen, was to avail myself of his services on such <a href="javascript:void(0);"
            onclick="return overlib('Again he reminds the reader that he hopes Bartleby will be available for what he freely admits are trivialities.', STICKY)"
            onmouseout="nd();" class="popup">trivial 
          occasions</a>. It was on the third day, I think, of his being
            with me, and before any necessity had arisen for having his own writing
            examined, that, being much hurried to complete a small affair I had in
            hand, I abruptly called to Bartleby. In my haste and <a href="javascript:void(0);"
            onclick="return overlib('According to his theory of management, when the boss says &quot;jump,&quot; his employees should say &quot;how high?&quot;', STICKY)"
            onmouseout="nd();" class="popup">natural

            over the original on my desk, and my right hand sideways, and somewhat
            nervously extended with the copy, so that immediately upon emerging from
            his retreat, Bartleby might <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('Evidently he doesn\'t know his man at all if he expects him to &quot;snatch&quot; anything!&nbsp;', STICKY)"
            onmouseout="nd();" class="popup">snatch</a> it and proceed to business without
            the least delay.</p>
        <p>In this very attitude did I sit when I called to him, rapidly stating
            what it was I wanted him to do--namely, to examine a small paper with me.
            Imagine my surprise, nay, my consternation, when without moving from his
            privacy, Bartleby in a singularly <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('These would seem to be very significant adjectives and they are used frequently to describe his voice and demeanor', STICKY)"

        </p>
        <p>I sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties. Immediately
            it occurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or Bartleby had entirely
            misunderstood my meaning. I repeated my request in the clearest tone I
            could assume. But in quite as clear a one came the previous reply, "I would
            prefer not to."</p>
        <p>"Prefer not to," echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing the
            room with a stride, "What do you mean? Are you <a href="javascript:void(0);"

        <p>"I would prefer not to," said he.</p>
        <p>I looked at him steadfastly. His face was leanly composed; his gray eye
            dimly calm. Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him. Had there been the

            me. I concluded to forget the matter for the present, reserving it for
            my future leisure. So calling Nippers from the other room, the paper was
            speedily examined.</p>
        <p>A few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being
            quadruplicates of a week's testimony taken before me in my High Court of
            Chancery. It became necessary to examine them. It was an important suit,
            and great accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged I called
            Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut from the next room, meaning to place the
            four copies in the hands of my four clerks, while I should read from the
            original. Accordingly Turkey, Nippers and Ginger Nut had taken their seats
            in a row, each with his document in hand, when I called to Bartleby to

            manner touched and disconcerted me. I began to reason with him.</p>
        <p>"These are your own copies we are about to examine. It is labor saving

        <p>"I prefer not to," he replied in a flute-like tone. It seemed to me that
            while I had been addressing him, he carefully revolved every statement
            that I made; fully comprehended the meaning; could not gainsay the irresistible
            conclusion; but, at the same time, some paramount consideration prevailed
            with him to reply as he did.</p>
        <p>"You are decided, then, not to comply with my request--a request made
            according to common usage and common sense?"</p>
        <p>He briefly gave me to understand that on that point <a href="javascript:void(0);"

            that you are."</p>

        <p>But he vouchsafed no reply. I pondered a moment in sore perplexity. But

            onmouseout="nd();" class="popup">again</a> to postpone the consideration
            of this dilemma to my future leisure. With a little trouble we made out
            to examine the papers without Bartleby, though at every page or two, Turkey
            deferentially dropped his opinion that this proceeding was quite out of
            the common; while Nippers, twitching in his chair with a dyspeptic nervousness,
            ground out between his set teeth occasional hissing maledictions against
            the stubborn oaf behind the screen. And for his (Nipper's) part, this was
            the first and the last time he would do another man's business without
            pay.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage, oblivious to every thing but
            his own peculiar business there.</p>
        <p>Some days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy work.
            His late remarkable conduct led me to regard his way narrowly. I observed
            that he never went to dinner; indeed that he never went any where. As yet
            I had never of my personal knowledge known him to be outside of my office.
            He was a <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('Again a military image, and a very immobile one at that.&nbsp;', STICKY)"
            onmouseout="nd();" class="popup">perpetual 
          sentry</a> in the corner. At about eleven o'clock though, in
            the morning, I noticed that Ginger Nut would advance toward the opening
            in Bartleby's screen, as if silently beckoned thither by a gesture invisible
            to me where I sat. That boy would then leave the office jingling a few
            pence, and reappear with a handful of ginger-nuts which he delivered in
            the hermitage, receiving two of the cakes for his trouble.</p>
        <p>He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; never eats a dinner, properly
            speaking; he must be a vegetarian then, but no; he never eats even vegetables,
            he <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('At this point he doesn\'t actually know that this is true, so why does he imagine that it is?', STICKY)"
            onmouseout="nd();" class="popup">eats

            concerning the probable effects upon the human constitution of living entirely
            on ginger-nuts. Ginger-nuts are so called because they contain ginger as
            one of their peculiar constituents, and the final flavoring one. Now what
            was ginger? A hot, spicy thing. Was Bartleby hot and spicy? Not at all.
            Ginger, then, had no effect upon Bartleby. Probably<a href="javascript:void(0);"

        <p>No answer.</p>
        <p>I threw open the folding-doors near by, and turning upon Turkey and Nippers,
            exclaimed in an excited manner--</p>
        <p>"He says, a second time, he won't examine his papers. What do you think
            of it, Turkey?"</p>
        <p>It was afternoon, be it remembered. Turkey sat glowing like a brass boiler,
            his bald head steaming, his hands reeling among his blotted papers.</p>
        <p>"Think of it?" roared Turkey; "I think I'll just step behind his screen,
            and black his eyes for him!"</p>

            when I detained him, alarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Turkey's
            combativeness after dinner.</p>
        <p>"Sit down, Turkey," said I, "and hear what Nippers has to say. What do
            you think of it, Nippers? Would I not be justified in immediately dismissing
            Bartleby?"</p>
        <p>"Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir. I think his conduct quite
            unusual, and indeed unjust, as regards Turkey and myself. But it may only
            be a passing whim."</p>

            usual rate of <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('This shows that Bartleby was not paid by the hour or salary, but &quot;by the piece,&quot; as the others must be.mThat means that the lawyer did not have to pay for work done slowly and poorly, only for acceptable work.', STICKY)"

        <p>32 As days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to Bartleby. His
            steadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry (except
            when he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his screen),
            his great stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under all circumstances,
            made him <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('The lawyer convinces himself of Bartleby\'s &quot;virtues.&quot; Note that he speaks of him not as a person, but a &quot;valuable acquisition&quot;! Do you think Bartleby is aware of this dehumanizing attitude?', STICKY)"

          valuable acquisition</a>. One prime thing was this,--he was
            always there;--first in the morning, continually through the day, and the
            last at night. I had a singular confidence in his honesty. I felt my most
            precious papers perfectly safe in his hands. Sometimes to be sure I could
            not, <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('what a curious statement! Is Bartleby in some way connected with the lawyer\'s soul?', STICKY)"
            onmouseout="nd();" class="popup">for

            passions with him. For it was exceeding difficult to bear in mind all the
            time those strange peculiarities, privileges, and unheard of exemptions,
            forming the tacit stipulations on Bartleby's part under which he remained
            in my office. Now and then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business,
            I would inadvertently summon Bartleby, in a short, rapid tone, to put his
            finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was
            about compressing some papers. Of course, from behind the screen the usual
            answer, "I prefer not to," was sure to come; and then, <a href="javascript:void(0);"

        <p>Here is must be said, that according to the custom of most legal gentlemen
            occupying chambers in densely-populated law buildings, there were several
            keys to my door. One was kept by a woman residing in the attic, which person
            weekly scrubbed and daily swept and dusted my apartments. Another was kept
            by Turkey for convenience sake. The third I sometimes carried in my own
            pocket. The fourth I knew not who had.</p>
        <p>Now, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, <a href="javascript:void(0);"
            onclick="return overlib('In other words, why else would he go to church? His moral condition does not seem to be very strong, or his generosity very deep.', STICKY)"

            on the ground, I thought I would walk round to my chambers for a while.
            Luckily I had my key with me; but upon applying it to the lock, I found
            it resisted by something inserted from the inside. Quite surprised, I called
            out; when to my consternation a key was turned from within; and thrusting
            his lean visage at me, and holding the door ajar, <a href="javascript:void(0);"

            me at present. In a brief word or two, he moreover added, that perhaps
            I had better walk round the block two or three times, and by that time
            he would probably have concluded his affairs. Now, the utterly <a href="javascript:void(0);"

            not without sundry twinges of impotent rebellion against the mild effrontery
            of this unaccountable scrivener. Indeed, it was his wonderful mildness
            chiefly, which not only disarmed me, but <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('A &quot;real man&quot; would have dealt immediately and definitely with such defiance, right?

            onmouseout="nd();" class="popup">order 
          him</a> away from his own premises. Furthermore, I was full of
            uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my office in
            his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition of a Sunday
            morning. Was any thing amiss going on? Nay, that was out of the question.
            It was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby was an immoral person.
            But what could he be doing there?--copying? Nay again, whatever might be
            his eccentricities, Bartleby was an eminently decorous person. He would
            be the last man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity.
            Besides, it was Sunday; and there was something about Bartleby that forbade
            the supposition that we would by any secular occupation violate <a href="javascript:void(0);"
            onclick="return overlib('One thing he likes about Bartleby is his dress and observation of &quot;proprieties,&quot; in short, how well he makes his boss to appear.&nbsp;', STICKY)"
            onmouseout="nd();" class="popup">the 
          proprieties</a> of the day.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless curiosity,
            at last I returned to the door. Without hindrance I inserted my key, opened
            it, and entered. Bartleby was not to be seen. I looked round anxiously,
            peeped behind his screen; but it was very plain that he was gone. Upon
            more closely examining the place, I surmised that for an indefinite period
            Bartleby must have ate, dressed, and slept in my office, and that too without
            plate, mirror, or bed. The cushioned seat of a rickety old sofa in one
            corner bore t faint impress of a lean, reclining form. Rolled away under
            his desk, I found a blanket; under the empty grate, a blacking box and
            brush; on a chair, a tin basin, with soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper
            a few crumbs of ginger-nuts and a morsel of cheese. Yet, thought I, it
            is evident enough that Bartleby has been making his home here, keeping

                across me, What miserable friendlessness and loneliness are here revealed!

                it is an emptiness. This building too, which of week-days hums with industry
                and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer vacancy, and all through Sunday
                is forlorn. And here Bartleby makes his home; sole spectator of a solitude

            the papers smoothly placed. The pigeon holes were deep, and removing the
            files of documents, I groped into their recesses. Presently I felt something
            there, and dragged it out. It was an old bandanna handkerchief, heavy and
            knotted. I opened it, and saw it was a savings' bank.</p>
        <p>I now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man. I
            remembered that he never spoke but to answer; that though at intervals
            he had considerable time to himself, yet I had never seen him reading--no,
            not even a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand looking out,
            at his pale window behind the screen, upon the dead brick wall; I was quite
            sure he never visited any refectory or eating house; while his pale face
            clearly indicated that he never drank beer like Turkey, or tea and coffee
            even, like other men; that he never went any where in particular that I
            could learn; never went out for a walk, unless indeed that was the case
            at present; that he had declined telling who he was, or whence he came,
            or whether he had any relatives in the world; that though so thin and pale,
            he never complained of ill health. And more than all, I remembered a certain

                The great point was, not whether I had assumed that he would quit me, but
                whether he would prefer so to do. He was more a <a href="javascript:void(0);"

        <p>After breakfast, I walked down town, arguing the probabilities pro and
            con. One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure, and Bartleby
            would be found all alive at my office as usual; the next moment it seemed
            certain that I should see his chair empty. And so I kept veering about.
            At the corner of Broadway and Canal- street, I saw quite an excited group
            of people standing in earnest conversation.</p>
        <p>"I'll take odds he doesn't," said a voice as I passed.</p>
        <p>"Doesn't go?--done!" said I, "put up your money."</p>
        <p>I was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce my own, when
            I remembered that this was an election day. The words I had overheard bore
            no reference to Bartleby, but to the success or non-success of some candidate
            for the mayoralty. In my intent frame of mind, I had, as it were, <a href="javascript:void(0);"

        <p>As I had intended, I was earlier than usual at my office door. I stood
            listening for a moment. All was still. He must be gone. I tried the knob.
            The door was locked. Yes, my procedure had worked to a charm; he indeed

            and in response a voice came to me from within--"Not yet; I am occupied."</p>
        <p>It was Bartleby.</p>

            out of this assumption, I might enter my office in a great hurry, and pretending
            not to see Bartleby at all, walk straight against him as if he were air.

        <p>Some few days after this, I again obtained admission to the Tombs, and

            "Yonder he lies--sleeping in the yard there. 'Tis not twenty minutes since
            I saw him lie down."</p>
