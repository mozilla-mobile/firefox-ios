In the course of asymptotic\n            freedom, the strong interaction becomes weaker at higher temperatures.\n            Eventually, color confinement would be lost and an extremely hot plasma\n            of freely moving quarks and gluons would be formed. This theoretical phase\n            of matter is called quark-gluon plasma.[81] The exact conditions needed\n            to give rise to this state are unknown and have been the subject of a great\n            deal of speculation and experimentation.",
