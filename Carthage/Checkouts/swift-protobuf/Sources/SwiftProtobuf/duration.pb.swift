/// A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
/// as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
/// resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
/// or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
/// two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
/// from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
///
///     Timestamp start = ...;
///     Timestamp end = ...;
///     Duration duration = ...;
///
///     duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
///     duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
///
///     if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
///       duration.seconds += 1;
///       duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
///     } else if (duration.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
///       duration.seconds -= 1;
///       duration.nanos += 1000000000;
///     }
///
/// Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
///
///     Timestamp start = ...;
///     Duration duration = ...;
///     Timestamp end = ...;
///
///     end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
///     end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
///
///     if (end.nanos < 0) {
///       end.seconds -= 1;
///       end.nanos += 1000000000;
///     } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
///       end.seconds += 1;
///       end.nanos -= 1000000000;
///     }
///
/// Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
///
///     td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
///     duration = Duration()
///     duration.FromTimedelta(td)
///
/// # JSON Mapping
///
/// In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an
/// object, where the string ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and
/// is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as
/// fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be
/// encoded in JSON format as "3s", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should
/// be expressed in JSON format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1
/// microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as "3.000001s".
