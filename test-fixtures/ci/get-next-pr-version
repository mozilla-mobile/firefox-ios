# Script Description:
# This script is designed to fetch the next version number for a pull request based on the highest version
# number found in the branch names of a given Git repository. It examines branches prefixed with 'release/v',
# identifies the highest numerical version, increments it by one, and outputs the next version number for use
# in automated processes, such as GitHub Actions.
#
# Usage:
# Execute the script directly in a Bash shell. The script prints the next version number to standard output.
# PLEASE NOTE: The output includes a debugging check for each command in the pipeline,
#   and the last line will always be the version number.
#   To get the version number, process the output of the script with 'tail -n 1'.
#
# Example for version number: new_version=$(bash get-next-pr-version | tail -n 1)
# Example for full output with debugging info:
#   output=$(bash get-next-pr-version)
#   echo "$output"
#   new_version=$(echo "$output" | tail -n 1)
#
# Example Full Output:
#   GNU bash, version 5.2.26(1)-release (aarch64-apple-darwin23.2.0)
