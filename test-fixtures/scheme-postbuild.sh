# UITests and XCUITests run this as a post-build step, to copy all files from
# test-fixtures into the app bundle, so they can be loaded by Client.app under
# test, for instance for having pregenerated prefs or pregenerated browser.db. 
#
# XCUITests in particular need this method of due to black-boxing of the host app.
# The Xcode-provided method to load test bundles does not work for App Groups.
