# ``ComponentLibrary/NavigationHeaderView``

The view which is used as a header for sheets, such as a bottom sheet, where some details are displayed, allowing navigation between screens.

## Overview

`NavigationHeaderView` is a subclass of `UIView`. It's a custom UIView that acts as a navigation header in an interface. It provides a title, a back button, and a close button, making it useful for navigation within menus or modal views. This view is ideal for use in navigation-driven applications where a header is needed to display a title and provide navigation controls for going back or closing a menu.
