# ``ComponentLibrary/SecondaryRoundedButton``

The button which is used for secondary actions.

## Overview

`SecondaryRoundedButton` is a subclass of `UIButton`. This means that the properties of `UIButton` are accessible, but it's recommended to configure the button title and accessibility identifier through its view model ``SecondaryRoundedButtonViewModel``. The colors, rounded corners, and spacing of the button, although accessible, shouldn't be adjusted and should be used as is.
