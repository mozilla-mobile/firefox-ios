# ``ComponentLibrary/PrimaryRoundedButton``

The button which is used for primary actions.

## Overview

`PrimaryRoundedButton` is a subclass of `UIButton`. This means that the properties of `UIButton` are accessible, however it's recommended to configure the button title and accessibility identifier through its view model ``PrimaryRoundedButtonViewModel``. The colors, rounded corners, and spacing of the button, although accessible, shouldn't be adjusted and should be used as is.
