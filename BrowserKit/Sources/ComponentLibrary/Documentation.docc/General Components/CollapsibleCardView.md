# ``ComponentLibrary/CollapsibleCardView``

The collapsible card view opens to show content on user press.

## Overview

`CollapsibleCardView` is a subclass of `ShadowCardView`. You should configure the card view content view, accessibility identifier, and state through its view model ``CollapsibleCardViewModel``. The rounded corners and padding around the content of the view shouldn't be adjusted and should be used as is.
