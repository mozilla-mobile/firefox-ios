# ``ComponentLibrary/LinkButton``

The button which is used for actions resembling a webview link.

## Overview

`LinkButton` is a subclass of `UIButton`. This means properties of `UIButton` are accessible, however it's recommended to configure the button title, font, and accessibility identifier through its view model ``LinkButtonViewModel``. The colors and spacing of the button, although accessible, shouldn't be adjusted and should be used as is.
