# ``ComponentLibrary/LinkButton``

The button which is used for actions that looks like a webview link.

## Overview

The `LinkButton` is a subclass of the `UIButton`. This means properties of the `UIButton` are accessible, but for easy convenience it's recommended to configure the button title, font and accessibility identifier through it's' view model ``LinkButtonViewModel``. The colors and spacing of the button although accessible shouldn't be adjusted and should be used as is.
