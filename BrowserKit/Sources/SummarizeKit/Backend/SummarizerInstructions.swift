/// NOTE on why `replacingOccurrences(of: "\n", with: " ")` is used.
/// The original instructions are a single line; It's split here into a multiline string for code readability.
/// This doesn‚Äôt change the character count though, since we are only swapping a space for a newline character.
/// The call to `replacingOccurrences(of: "\n", with: " ")` then reverts it back to a single line
/// because tokenizers may treat newlines as distinct tokens, whereas spaces are merged more efficiently.
/// For more context on how tokenizers handle newlines vs spaces, see: https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/8/gpt-tokenizers/
