# 0. Use Markdown Architectural Decision Records

Date: 2025-10-09

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in [this article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

### Positive
- One ADR describes one significant decision for a specific project.
- The consequences of one ADR are very likely to become the context for subsequent ADRs.
- Developers and project stakeholders can see the ADRs, even as the team composition changes over time.
- The motivation behind previous decisions is visible for everyone, present and future.
