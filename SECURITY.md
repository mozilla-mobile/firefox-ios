# Firefox Security FAQ

General information about security at Mozilla is available at [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/).

## I want to report a security bug\!

Please report Firefox bugs in our Bugzilla instance by using [our bug bounty form](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.client.bounty). Be aware that your e-mail address will be made public. See our [Bugzilla etiquette](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html) for more.

## Do you have a bounty program?

We have two:

* Firefox browsers fall under the [Firefox bug bounty program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/client-bug-bounty/) which is handled on Bugzilla.
* The general [Mozilla Security Bug Bounty Program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/) also covers other products and services and is on HackerOne.

## I have a question\! Who can help?

Questions regarding security bugs or our bounty programs can be directed to [security@mozilla.com](mailto:security@mozilla.com). An encryption key for sending [GPG encrypted mails](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/#pgpkey) is also available.
