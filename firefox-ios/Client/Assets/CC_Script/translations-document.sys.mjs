/**
 * This class manages the process of translating the DOM from one language to another.
 *
 * The logic within this class is generally separated into two types of translations:
 * Content Translations and Attribute Translations.
 *
 *  - For Content Translations, the DOM is traversed, filtered, and subdivided into smaller
 *    groups of Nodes that have translatable text content.
 *
 *  - For Attribute Translations, a series of query selectors are used to filter all of
 *    the Nodes that have translatable attributes within the DOM.
 *
 * Once nodes have been identified for both Content Translations and Attribute Translations,
 * they are then registered for intersection observation and mutation observation.
 *
 * The mutation observer notifies us when a Node's content has changed, when a Node's translatable
 * attributes have changed, as well as when new nodes are added into the DOM tree, and need to be
 * further filtered, subdivided, and registered for intersection observation.
 *
 * In total, four intersection observers are used to prioritize which nodes should be translated: two to
 * handle content-translation observations, and the other two to handle attribute-translation observations.
 *
 * Once intersections have been observed, the relevant nodes are sent into a queue where they will
 * wait to be assigned a priority, based on both the type of translation, as well as the Node's location
 * relative to the viewport of the screen.
 *
 * Prioritized nodes are then sent to the translation scheduler @see {TranslationScheduler}, which
 * will attempt to optimally send requests to the TranslationsEngine worker to be translated, based
 * both on the engine's throughput as well as on how many new translation requests are coming in.
 *
 * Once a request has come back from the TranslationsEngine worker, its response is validated, then
 * the relevant node's content or attribute is scheduled to be updated in the DOM with the corresponding
 * result of the translation.
 *
 * Note that a pending translation request may be cancelled at any stage in this process, up until the point
 * where the request has come back from the TranslationsEngine worker, and the Node's content or attribute
 * has been replaced in the DOM. Cancellations may happen for one of several reasons:
 *
 *  1) The page has been hidden (such as switching tabs), and we are pausing all execution until it is shown again.
 *  2) The user has scrolled to a new location on the page entirely, and prior requests are no longer relevant.
 *  3) A Node's location with respect to the viewport has changed and it needs a new translation priority.
 *  4) A Node's content has mutated within the DOM, and the pending translation request is no longer relevant.
 *
 * The following diagram shows the flow of translations throughout the entire lifecycle of the TranslationsDocument.

   * to the TranslationScheduler.
   *
   * Does nothing if a callback is already pending.
   *
   * The callback registered by this function uses a dynamic rate limit, where the time between sending
   * a batch of requests to the scheduler is much longer if the user is actively scrolling around the page.
   *
   * The intersection observers are constantly monitoring the locations of nodes within the page,
   * enqueuing them to be scheduled when they get near to the viewport, cancelling their requests
   * when they exit the viewport, etc.
   *
   * When an intersection observer needs to cancel a translation request, it is much cheaper to
   * remove the node from the queue before it gets assigned a priority submitted to the scheduler.
   * If we submit a translation request for every node that gets close to the viewport immediately
   * then we will waste a lot of resources cancelling all of those requests if the viewport moves.
   *
   * So we want to have some mechanism to throttle how frequently nodes are submitted to the scheduler,
   * allowing the intersection observers to rapidly resolve the ideal state by adding and removing nodes
   * from the queues before we pause to schedule translations for all of the nodes currently in the queues.
   *
   * However, if we wait too long between each time we send requests to the scheduler, the user experience
   * will no longer feel fluid and reactive.
   *
   * When the user is scrolling, the observers are going to be adding and cancelling many nodes in rapid
   * succession as their spatial contexts relative to the viewport change. We need to allow extra time
   * to cheaply resolve the state of the queues before sending requests to the scheduler.
   *
   * When the user is not scrolling, new nodes may still be entering or exiting proximity with te viewport,
   * but in this case it is often due to closed caption text updates on a video, or a chat section for a live
   * stream being flooded with new comments. Here we want to prioritize and submit much more quickly so that
   * we can react fluidly to dynamic changes on the page.

/**
 * The AntiStarvationStack is a stack-like data structure with a predefined batch size.
 * Requests are pushed to the stack one at a time, but they may only be popped in a batch.
 *
 * The stack keeps track of whether the net count of requests has increased or decreased
 * between each time it pops a batch of request. If the size of the stack has not decreased
 * since the previous time a batch was popped, then it means that more requests are being
 * pushed to the stack than are being popped from the stack, and the stack is considered
 * to have starving requests.
 *
 * This terminology is derived from the idea that if the stack is growing faster than it is
 * processing, then requests at the bottom of the stack will never be popped, and they will starve,
 * i.e. they will never have a chance to be processed.
 *
 *  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)
 *
 * In order to ensure fairness in processing, when the stack has starving requests it will pull
 * a predefined portion of the batch from the bottom of the stack, instead of only from the top.
 * This ensures that if the stack is growing faster than it can be processed, we are guaranteed
 * to eventually process the oldest requests in the stack, given enough time, and no request will
 * ever starve entirely.
 *
 * It is recommended that the starvation batch portion is less than or equal half of the batch size.
 * This ensures that priority is still given to newer requests, as is the intent of the stack, while
 * still ensuring fairness in scheduling.
 *
 * The following is a diagram of several calls to popBatch(), demonstrating both normal calls to
 * popBatch() as well as calls to popBatch() under starvation conditions:
