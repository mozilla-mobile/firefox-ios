/// Preconfigured sharing schemes which the share manager knows how to handle.
///     file: Include a file URL (`file://`). Best used for sharing downloaded files.
///     site: Include a website URL (`http(s)://`). Best used for sharing library/bookmarks, etc. without an active tab.
///           Shares configured using .site will not append a title to Messages but will have a subtitle in Mail.
///     tab:  Include a URL and a tab to share. If sharing a tab with an active webView, then additional sharing
///           options can be configured, including printing the page and adding the webpage to your iOS home screen.
///           __SPECIAL NOTE__: If you download a PDF, you can view that in a tab. In that case, the URL may have a `file://`
///            scheme instead of `http(s)://`, so certain options, like Send to Device / Add to Home Screen, may not be
///            available.
