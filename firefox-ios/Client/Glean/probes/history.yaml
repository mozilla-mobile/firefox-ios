    type: event
    description: |
      Recorded when a user undergoes a successful application services history
      migration. This migration occurs for users updating their app from
      version 110. The migration ensures the user preserves all their browsing
      history. This migration was added in the fall of 2022.

      This setting can safely be expired after we have ensured that the history
      migration code is no longer required (due to low event counts).
