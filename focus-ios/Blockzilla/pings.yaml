  reasons:
    dirty_startup: |
      The ping was submitted at startup, because the application process was
      killed before the Glean SDK had the chance to generate this ping, before
      becoming inactive, in the last session.
    inactive: |
      The ping was submitted when becoming inactive.
    active: |
      The ping was submitted when the application became active again,
      which includes when the application starts.
